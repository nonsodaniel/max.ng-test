On line 24. var err error is not a correct way of declaring 'err' 

correct response >> var err = error if you are declaring the initial value;

case study 1 >>
var foo *zoo -foo is assigned pointer to struct Zee. It definitely has a type

case study 2 >>
foo :=*zee used for implicit types(when you don't know the type)
